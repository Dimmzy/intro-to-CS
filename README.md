# Intro to CS
Includes assignments made as part of the Intro to CS course in Bar-Ilan University.
<h3> Exercise 1 - Programming Basics - Python</h3>
Basic number and array manipulation examples as a starting point to programming in python.
<h3> Exercise 2 - Calculators and String Manipulation - C</h3>
- Base conversion <br />
- ASCII to number conversion <br />
- float/integer respresentation and differntiation<br />
- Custom calculator<br />
- Create polynomial from coefficients<br />
<h3> Exercise 3 - Primality Test - C & Python</h3>
Programs (both in C and Python) to test if a number is a prime using primality tests (up to the root of the number).<br />
One of the main ideas was to demonstrate the performance difference between Python and C, where C is dominant in terms of raw computing speed, while python is easier to read/write (argubly).<br />
<h3> Exercise 4 - Collatz Conjecture and Fermat's Last Therorem - C </h3> 
Function to calculate the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) for given n.  
And a function to calculate the pythagorean triples as given by [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem).  
First major exercise that puts an emphasis on proper coding style and helper functions.
