# Intro to CS
Includes assignments made as part of the Intro to CS course in Bar-Ilan University.
# Exercise 1 - Programming Basics - Python
Basic number and array manipulation examples as a starting point to programming in python.
# Exercise 2 - Calculators and String Manipulation - C
- Base conversion  
- ASCII to number conversion  
- float/integer respresentation and differntiation  
- Custom calculator  
- Create polynomial from coefficients  
# Exercise 3 - Primality Test - C & Python
Programs (both in C and Python) to test if a number is a prime using primality tests (up to the root of the number).  
One of the main ideas was to demonstrate the performance difference between Python and C, where C is dominant in terms of raw computing speed, while python is easier to read/write (argubly).  
# Exercise 4 - Collatz Conjecture and Fermat's Last Therorem - C
Function to calculate the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) for given n.  
And a function to calculate the pythagorean triples as given by [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem).  
First major exercise that puts an emphasis on proper coding style and helper functions.
# Exercise 5 - Student Register & Memory Management - C 
Managing a student register that allows the addition, deletion of students and editing their information, as well as extracting useful information such as GPA and courses taken.  
Implemented using a dynamic array with concise memory management (allocation and deallocation) and extensive pointer usage.
# Exercise 6 - Josephus Problem - C
Implementation of a game simulating the [Jospehus Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem).  
Allows the creation of "games" of up to n players and then commencing the game to see which position is the safe one.  
Uses pointers and structs extensively to simulate links between added players, which allows us to perform functions on a chain of players to simulate the game.
